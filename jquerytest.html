<p>Billie Eilish gained recognition at just 14 with her song "Ocean eyes"</p>
    
<p>Fun fact! Unlike most artists, Billie doesn't use autotune for her songs; probably a factor that helped shoot her to fame.</p>
    
<p>Another fun fact! Billie Eilish was homeschooled all her life. Homeschooling was crucial partly because Billie deals with auditory processing disorder—it's hard for her to listen and absorb meaning in standard ways—but it had the happy side effect of sharpening her sense of self. 
  “I never went to school, so popular was never a thing for me.</p>
    
<p>Billie's brother, Finneas, writes her songs for her, which they then record in her bedroom in her parents home </p>
